            <h2><b>Leila Resedential Compound:</b></h2>
            <h3>My first fully-opeartional serviced software project for a residential compound in New Cairo
                known as Leila Compound: an application that allows residents to submit complaints
                that are sent to the maintenance/security departments of the compound, and by which residents
                can view the status of their complaints, and by which the respective administrative 
                departments can change the status of each complaint. Developed using <b>ReactJS</b> for a responsive
                frontend and <b>Firebase</b> for a free and reliable backend.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Duration:</b> 1-2 Weeks<br>
                <b>Estimated Costs by a SW company:</b> 50-60K EGP <br>
                <b>Actual Costs (Myself):</b> 0 EGP <br>

            <h2><b>Scandiweb job application test-task (E-commerce):</b></h2>
            <h3>In the first quarter of 2024, a Latvian company known as Scandiweb tasked me to develop
                an e-commmerce web application with specific requirements using <b>ReactJS</b> as a frontend, 
                <b>PHP</b> for the backend, <b>MySQL</b> for the database, and <b>GraphQL</b> for the api. The
                main challenge encountered in this project was the application of the newly learned GraphQL API
                technology and the implementation of a logical strucuture for the database.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Duration:</b> 1-2 Months<br>
                <b>Estimated Costs by Scandiweb:</b> 0 EGP <br>
                <b>Actual Costs (Myself):</b> 0 EGP <br>
